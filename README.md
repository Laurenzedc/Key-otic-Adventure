# Key-otic Adventure – A Console-Based OOP Puzzle Game
Key-otic Adventure is a story-driven Java console game inspired by escape rooms and Jumanji-style game worlds.
You play as a trapped adventurer who must complete five levels, solve puzzles, choose paths, and switch between characters to survive. Each level contains obstacles and directional choices that lead to different story outcomes, eventually allowing you to collect keys needed to open the Final Chest containing the Ultimate Gem—your only way home.

This project showcases practical applications of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, modular coding structure, puzzle classes, character management, level logic, and randomization.
